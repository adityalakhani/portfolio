Why India Has a Steep Demographic Dividend?
India's demographic dividend refers to the economic growth potential from its young population. Here's a quick breakdown:

Young Workforce: Over 50% of India's population is under 25, providing a large labor force.
Economic Impact: A higher working-age population can boost GDP if employed productively.
Challenges:
Education: Need for quality education to skill the youth.
Jobs: Creating enough employment opportunities.
Healthcare: Ensuring a healthy workforce.



India's window of opportunity is open until around 2040. Strategic investments now can maximize this dividend.
Fun Fact: India's median age is 28, compared to 38 in China and 48 in Japan!
