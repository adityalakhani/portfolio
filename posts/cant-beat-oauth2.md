Can't Beat OAuth2
OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to access user resources without exposing credentials. Here's a quick overview:

How it works: A user authenticates with an authorization server, which issues an access token to the client app. The client uses this token to access protected resources.
Key components:
Authorization Server: Issues tokens.
Resource Server: Hosts protected resources.
Client: The app requesting access.
Access Token: A string granting access.


Why use it?: Secure, scalable, and user-friendly.

# Example: OAuth2 flow with Python
import requests

# Step 1: Redirect user to auth server
auth_url = "https://auth-server.com/authorize?client_id=your_client_id&redirect_uri=your_redirect_uri&response_type=code"

# Step 2: Exchange code for access token
code = "user_auth_code"
token_response = requests.post("https://auth-server.com/token", data={
    "client_id": "your_client_id",
    "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
    "code": code,
    "grant_type": "authorization_code",
    "redirect_uri": "your_redirect_uri"
})

access_token = token_response.json().get("access_token")
